<title>2009 BOPD SCA: Assignment: Period 3 - Botball Lessons Learned</title>

<div>

   <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>What did you gain from the 
Botball experience?</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our 
motley team consisted of casual lifelong roboticists, veteran Botball 
participants, hotshot computer software developers, dedicated documenters, 
and others who were less experienced but equally enthusiastic, and thus, 
just as productive. From this astounding diversity we derived our strength, 
but it was a challenge keeping everybody working in harmony with one 
another. Towards the beginning of season, one day a hardware person 
would build a mechanism, the next, another would take it apart and redesign 
it; we operated at cross purposes. But by the end, we had established 
effective communication between our team members – hardware and software 
and documentation – and were able to operate in parallel for the benefit 
of all.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>What did you gain from the 
documentation process?</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Most 
of all, by documenting, we realized the amount of viable ideas we discussed 
and rapidly forgot about. We made a habit of recording any conversations 
we had on strategy or design or point scoring as not to miss any details 
for documentation, and suddenly, we realized how much important information 
we had been otherwise rapidly forgetting. Furthermore, the hard deadlines 
motivated us not to procrastinate – a single Internet connection failure 
and we would be virtually out of the running to win the regional tournament 
for lack of documentation points. The work ethic we learned here will 
certainly persist throughout our academic career and hopefully, our 
lives.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>What surprised you most 
about your Botball experience?</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our 
team was stunned by our collective enthusiasm for the task set before 
us. Generally, the “group projects” are dreaded for the lethargy 
they induce in the less motivated members, but here, perhaps because 
Botball is an optional and inherently fun activity (and are team members 
are all excellent academics), we had very little slacking and relatively 
consistent meeting attendance. And we worked extremely efficiently when 
present.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, 
we were consistently surprised by the brilliance of our fellow teammates: 
and every meeting revealed heretofore unseen skills in our coders, builders, 
and documenters, even though many of us have known one another for years. 
For example, one day in week two or three, Jacob and Minh – our main 
hardware designers –arrived at a meeting to find a new, extremely 
robust prototype of the LEGO Bot drive train sitting on the floor. We 
were perplexed: where could this have come from? Did a butterfly flap 
its wings somewhere across the world and cause a strange eddy in the 
air currents that, upon reaching San Diego entered our Botball workspace 
and blew the LEGO and Vex pieces into a perfect mechanism? After considering 
that hypothesis for a few moments, we decided it to be somewhat unlikely, 
so we asked the team what had happened. It turned out that Mark, one 
of our main software developers, had suddenly come upon great inspiration 
and worked late into the night carrying out his ideas. To this day, 
we use his superbly economical, astoundingly reliable driving base that 
he constructed on that inspired evening.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>What advice would you pass 
on to future Botball teams?</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Above 
all, we would advise future Botball teams to select their members based 
on willingness, dedication, and experience, not innate skill or intelligence, 
or academic renown. Although many people on our team possess the latter 
qualities, those do not necessarily bring about successful completion 
and refinement of a robot – that takes week after week, day after 
day – late evening after later evening – of focus, practice, and 
unquenchable enthusiasm. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Also, 
do not feel like you <i>have</i> to include complicated mechanisms in 
your robots to win or succeed or be reliable. Instead, adhere to spiral 
model of development: rush to build something that works, test it extensively, 
then redesign and repeat the process. You will have enough trouble making 
it work reliably when <b>K</b>eeping <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple. Besides, 
complexity will rapidly evolve on its own. That was our team’s problem 
last year, and our success in avoiding that pitfall this year is why 
we have thus far achieved the rather ambitious goals we have set.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Other Notes:</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
We learned that it was important to hardcode motion before integrating 
sensor feedback – initially, we attempted to include as many cameras 
and IR rangefinders and other detection devices as possible (“More 
sensor input is better, right?” we erroneously reasoned). Instead, 
it is better to progress as far as possible without sensor only add 
them when absolutely necessary. Doing otherwise actually leads to less 
reliable code: it is likely that somewhere, a sensor value will end 
up untripped due to the unpredictability of arena conditions. Instead, 
only rely on the most consistent and most important feedback.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We 
also learned that metal should be used whenever it can be, and certainly 
on all weight-bearing mechanisms. LEGO pieces are simply not dependable 
enough: a 9/10 success rate is not acceptable if victory is the goal. 
That is what prompted the redesign of our LEGO robot.</font></p>
