<strong>Concept #1</strong></br><br>
</br>
<br><strong>What will the robot try to score?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will try to knock BotGuy off the two green turbine foundations and then bulldoze all three objects up to the peak in order to score the three points each for the foundations (totaling six points) and also to triple the total score. The Create will also attempt to take the two waters to the peak on the way as well, adding thirty points each (totaling sixty points). It will not attempt to collect the other two waters because we want to make sure that we can get those two waters and BotGuy up to the peak first, in order to ensure that we can get a substantial amount of points. The original windmill that is allowed in the starting box will also be placed on the bulldozer so that it gets pushed up to the peak to score an additional ten points (thirty when tripled). Thus, the total should amount to seventy-six points, plus the additional points collected by the LegoBot; the total of which will be tripled. This guarantees a minimum of 228 points for the Create alone.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The LegoBot will be in charge of gathering one of the windmills in the white mobile holder in the valley, bringing it up to the peak, and then stacking it on top of one of the three yellow foundations to score thirty points; which then gets tripled because of BotGuy. It will then return to grab the other windmill and white mobile holder and repeat to earn us sixty points total; equivalent to 180 points when tripled. We will, however, be unable to get points for bringing the mobile holders up and neither will we be able to recycle them in the starting box later. If time permits, the bot will attempt to grab the windmill located at the edge of one of the starting boxes, and insert it into the yellow foundations as well; adding another thirty points to our total (ninety points when tripled), and then return to get the other one. However, it will be hard to place the windmill into the yellow foundations so they may end up just scoring ten points for being in the peak (thirty points each when tripled). The total points scored for the LegoBot should amount to 180 points for the windmills in the mobile holder, and from sixty to 180 points for the windmills at the edge of the starting box (depending on whether they end up in the foundations or not). This guarantees a minimum of 180 points and up to 360 points total, if time permits and if we have some luck in getting them in the foundations.<br />
  If we use this Create and LegoBot matchup, we will be able to score 408 points minimally and up to 588 points, assuming that we are able to get to everything before the other team does.<br />
</p>
<br><strong>How will the robot score those points?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The bot will score these points with a detachable bulldozer. The Create will sense the red on BotGuy with the camera and will proceed to push it off, by bulldozing the green turbine foundations on which it is standing. The Create will next find the blue waters with the camera, and add them to the bulldozed collection. After transporting BotGuy, the two foundations, and the two waters to the peak, the bulldozer will detach from the Create. As the Create approaches and comes close enough to the yellow turbine foundations at the top, the servos will be directed to release/unclamp the bulldozer.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The LegoBot will score these points with its double grippers that will grasp onto the windmills and their mobile holders and bring them to the peak to stack on top of the yellow turbine foundations. <br />
</p>
<br><strong>What key features will the robot have?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The goals of the Create are centered on the detachable bulldozer, which is mounted to the back of the Create. It faces outward from the Create in order to form a crate that traps BotGuy, the foundations, and the waters. In order to move the five items up the slope to the peak, the Create will travel backwards to keep them from escaping. The bulldozer has plastic pegs at the end of the arms of the bulldozer to support the heavy metal rods, and thus keeping the bulldozer balanced. The plastic pegs located throughout the arms of the bulldozer are used to keep the foundations from escaping and to also further strengthen the arms. The arms are designed to be able to pass over the PVC pipes that outline the perimeter of the board, thus permitting the Create to be able to travel everywhere on the board. The Create drops off the bulldozer at the peak in order to keep the objects there, while it continues to accomplish other tasks; such as recycling the plastic fuel containers and the foundations to score more points. The bulldozer is attached by hooks on the Create that latch onto the bulldozer, which get released by the servos. The screws at the bottom of the bulldozer provide friction to keep the bulldozer from sliding down from the peak and thus ensure that the optimum amount of points can be scored. </br>
<br>
<strong>LegoBot</strong>: It will have two sets of arms, with each set having one arm on top of the other. The upper arm/claw will be capable of contracting almost completely so that it can grasp onto the pencil/pole of the windmill. The arm/claw can close enough, so that the paper part of the windmill will rest on the claws and thus keep it in place. The lower claw is larger so that it can grip onto the white mobile holder in which the windmill pole lies. By keeping the lower end of the windmill in place in the mobile holders, it will keep the windmill oriented so that it can be directly stacked onto the yellow foundations at the peak; earning us more points. In other words, the two claws will pick up the entire windmill-mobile holder complex together, with the pole held by the upper claw and guided by the lower claw. The other set of arms.<br />
</p>
<br><strong>What are the most difficult aspects of implementing this concept?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The hardest part of constructing the bulldozer was mounting it to the Create in a way so that it was stable and balanced, yet detachable. Initially, the bulldozer was too heavy, so it kept slipping down and it kept tipping the Create backward, but this problem was solved by adding pegs to the open end of the bulldozer to keep the bulldozer from weighing down the Create, as well as the servos. It was also difficult to position the servos so that the hooks will open out when it was time to release the bulldozer. The hooks also protect the bulldozer from detaching if it gets rammed by the other team's bot.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: It will be very difficult to grasp the windmills and the mobile holders under them with the double grippers as they would have to be spaced perfectly to be grabbed. It is also unlikely that the mobile holders will be stacked perfectly enough on the turbine foundations to rest on them stably and not topple over. The double grippers themselves would be very hard to build in that all the measurements have to be very precise and it would require significant modifications to work even decently well.</br>
<br></br>
<br><strong>What is the likelihood that you will use this design? If rejected, state why.</strong></br>
<br>It is very likely that we will implement the Create part of this plan. It seems to be the most efficient at scoring the greatest amount of points, in the least amount of time. The bulldozer is a very reliable way to get BotGuy to the peak while picking up a few other objects on the way up as well. If the Create is able to score just BotGuy and the two waters, we will have a minimum of 180 points, which will make the other team have to collect almost all the other parts to match/surpass us. We are still skeptical about the gripper for the LegoBot however, because we tried to implement a similar concept of having a forklift last year but we failed to get it to work properly. The bot is also very inefficient in that it can only score about 60 points maximum at a time and those points won’t necessarily be scored either. Luck would have to play a significant role in the success of the LegoBot. Having the gripper on the LegoBot seems unnecessary and it will be a waste of time to engineer and program such a complex appendage. We want to keep our strategies simple this year and the LegoBot will probably bring a lot of trouble.</br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Concept #2</strong></br><br></br>
<br><strong>What will the robot try to score?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will try to score the waters, trebbles, and BotGuy (totaling 75 points which then gets tripled). The Create will attempt to take the two waters to the peak; adding thirty points each (totaling sixty points). It will not attempt to collect the other two waters because we want to make sure that we can get those two waters and BotGuy up to the peak first (in order to ensure that we can get a substantial amount of points). The original windmill allowed in the starting box will also be placed in the grapple, so it gets taken up to the peak to score an additional ten points (thirty points when tripled). Thus, the total should amount to 85 points, totaling 255 points when tripled. </br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The LegoBot will not be scoring any points, but will instead attempt to prevent the other team from scoring any items on their slope and peak. </p>
<p><strong>How will the robot score those points?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will try to score these points using a grapple. The Create will sense the red on BotGuy using a camera and will grab BotGuy using its grapple. The Create will grab BotGuy with its grapple, and put it in the basket, that is placed in-between the Create and the grapple. The Create will next find the blue waters, using the camera, and add them to the basket collection. After transporting BotGuy, the two foundations, and the two waters to the peak, the basked will tilt sideways from the Create, dropping everything on the peak. </br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: At the beginning, the LegoBot will leave the starting box and immediately head towards the other team’s slope by following the black tape on the board [top hat IR sensor]. At the intersection between the valley and the slope, the LegoBot will position itself and deploy two blocker arms to each side to block the opposing team from traveling anywhere beyond the valley. </p>
<p><strong>What key features will the robot have?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The goals of the Create are centered on the tilting basket and the grapple, which are attached to the front of the Create. In order to move the five items up the slope to the peak, the Create will put the items in the basket, ensuring that they don’t fall out. The grapple is designed to be able to grab the item, raise it up, and place it into the basket behind it. The Create empties off the basket at the peak; then it will continue to accomplish other tasks: such as recycling the plastic fuel containers and the foundations to score more points. The grapple and basket are mounted on the Create; and the basket is able to tilt… somehow.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The LegoBot will have two arms on each side of the robot facing up vertically. Once the LegoBot reaches its blocking destination (intersection of the valley and slope), these arms will lower outward into a horizontal position to act as a barricade to prevent anything from entering or leaving the enemy’s slope and peak. Servos will be mounted at the base of each arm and attached to the base of the LegoBot. These two servos will cause the arms to lower into their blocking position. Each arm will have a wheel mounted near the top of the arms. The wheels will be oriented such that when the arms lower to act as the barricade, the wheels will be laying flat and facing down to provide friction to the LegoBot in case anything significantly powerful (like the enemy’s robot) would try to force its way through. At the front of the LegoBot, there will be a pivot wheel with a mounted servo controlling the directions the LegoBot turns. The servo would turn the pivot wheel and the LegoBot would accelerate to reach its destination.</br>
<p><strong>What are the most difficult aspects of implementing this concept?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The hardest part of constructing the grapple and basket was to make the grapple bend backwards in order to place it in the basket. The hardest part about building the basket is the way to make it tilt.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The most difficult aspect of implementing this concept would be the pivot wheel. The servo will have to control the rotation of the wheel and any malfunction will cause major devastation to our plan as it would render the LegoBot completely useless. Another difficult aspect would be to make the vertical arms fold outward into their blocking position. If these were to fail, the LegoBot would not be very much of an effective blocker as the surface area of the LegoBot would not be sufficient enough to block everything from entering or leaving the enemy’s slope/peak and cause our scheme to malfunction completely.</br>
<p><strong>What is the likelihood that you will use this design? If rejected, state why.</strong></br>
<br>
It is very likely that we will implement the LegoBot blocker part of this design, but not the Create grapple basket. The grapple basket requires a lot of unnecessary work and time and the success of the idea is not particularly promising or reliable. The LegoBot, however, seems to be a very plausible idea because it would not be too difficult to engineer and it would almost prevent the other team from scoring any significant points. Even if they are able to reach BotGuy before us, they will not be able to bring him to the slope or peak to boost the number of points. If we really were to use the LegoBot blocker idea, we could easily have the Create bring a few objects to our own peak and thus outscore the other team. The only downside is that if the other team is able to predict that we are going to implement the LegoBot blocker, then we would have to rely only on the Create to score the points for us. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Concept #3</strong></p>
<p><strong>What points will the robots try to score?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will not actively score any points, however, it will prevent the opposing side from creating positive points, thereby increasing our score.</br>
<br><strong>Legobot</strong>: The Legobot will attempt to grab the cup of fossil fuels near the starting box and the cup of green poms directly in front of it. It will determine which side the five green poms are on. In doing so, the Legobot will ideally score 60 points from all of these poms, because all 20 will be placed on the peak.</br>
<p><strong>How will the robots score those points?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will use hard coding to turn towards the opposing team's starting box, and very quickly &quot;sprint&quot; to that area in order to block as well as possible.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: First, the robot will use the camera to quickly center on the fossil fuels, drive toward them, and gather them. Afterwards, it will quickly center on the nearby green poms, drive toward them, and gather them as well. Afterwards, the LegoBot will use the camera to determine the side on which the green poms reside. It will center on those green poms, and then quickly gather them. It will subsequently move towards the fossil fuels located on the slope via usage of camera centering methods. Afterwards, the robot will turn around, and will then use a backwards dumping motion to deposit the collected tribbles at the peak. The Legobot will then stay in that location in order to prevent interference from the opposing team as well as keep the scored tribbles at the peak.</br>
<p><strong>What key features will the robots have?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The Create will have a CBC mount, and will have a brake-like system. The brake system will consist of two lego tires which can translate vertically. By use of the front bumpers already on the Create, upon collision with another robot, the lego tires will move down, and by friction, help keep the Create from sliding and/or being moved by the opposing team's robot.</br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The Legobot will be based on the &quot;garbage truck&quot; design.  It will feature a scooper mounted in the front of the robot.  The scooper will be have a smooth metal piece on the bottom to be able to scoop item on the ground. There will also be guide rails made of lego pieces on the edges of the scooper to prevent pieces from escaping the scooper.  The scooper will be &quot;dumped&quot; to the basket on the back side of the robot.  The basket will also be made of legos and will be able to tilt on an axis.  This allows us to dump all of the robot's contents into the peak.</br>
<p><strong>What are the most difficult aspects of implementing this concept?</strong></br>
<br><strong>Create</strong>: The most difficult aspects of implementing this concept for the Create will be in correctly arriving at the starting box, and in very little time. This will be difficult because we will be hard coding in order to save time, but consistent accuracy could be lost. We also want to make sure that we do not disturb the poms which the LegoBot hopes to gather, but this could be lost in a hard coding, quick process. Another very difficult aspect of the Create's implementation will be in making sure enough friction is maintained in the Lego wheel brakes. This will be essential to the Create's success in that it will help prevent the opposing team's robots from scoring points, by stopping any forced motion on our Create. </br>
<br><strong>LegoBot</strong>: The most difficult aspect of implementing the LegoBot's concept will be in the scooping mechanism.   The mechanism will need be able to flip and then dump its contents into the basket in the back of the robot.  This mechanism would need a strong base,and therefore should also allow servos to perform the dumping motion.    The dumping motion that the basket will perform will be another difficult aspect of implementing this concept.  The basket would have one side that swings out when it is tilted on an axis.  The poms should be roll out of the basket, but because they are so light, they might not have enough momentum.  Also, since the basket is made out of lego pieces, they might trap some of the poms inside the basket.  Another difficult aspect is the ability to navigate through the map effectively.  We will probably end up using the camera for navigating throughout the map. It would be a problem if the scooper moved the camera while it is dumping the poms.  Mounting the camera on the CBC will prove to be a difficult task.</p>
<p><strong>What is the likelihood that you will use this design? If rejected, state why.</strong></br>
<br>We have rejected this concept for the reason that it is risky and very potentially inconsistent due to complexity (which, incidentally, is against the mantra of KISS). It is probable that the Create would not be able to reach the starting box in time, and in this situation it would be essentially useless. Also, it is possible that the Create could disturb the poms which the LegoBot hopes to gather. Even if this does not happen, the LegoBot's &quot;garbage truck&quot; design would be extremely hard to implement mechanically speaking, and would likely be inconsistent.  Dumping the poms would also be problematic. Our baskets on our robot last year always trapped at least one pom.  If three poms were stuck in the basket, we would lose nine potential points assuming that the robot is in the peak.  We wouldn't want something as unreliable as a basket to be our &quot;breadwinner&quot; during the competition.  In past years, we have found that the robots which do not have such complex mechanical structures have a higher likelihood of success, as would be appropriate in a competition sponsored by an institute which even in name promotes simplicity. </br>
