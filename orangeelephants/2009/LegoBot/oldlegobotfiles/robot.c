1/25/09 - So far I have gotten the motors to drive forward and also tested out the back wheel servo
It now goes straight but could use a litte more testing and stability on the drive train
The back wheel's structure should also be reinforced.
We will use two more motors on this robot to have the arms go down and block their slope
