<p class="style2">Period 2 – Prototyping and Testing Robot Refinement</p>
<p class="style1">Create</p>
<p><strong>LEGObot Speed vs. Create and Bulldozer Speed </strong></p>
<p><strong>Briefly describe the testing procedure.</strong><br />
The first test was a rather simple experiment to test the size of the bulldozer device. The Create was placed in the starting box in front of the LEGObot, and the size was checked to ensure that the bars did not exceed botball limitations. If there was a violation, the device was adjusted until limitations were met. We were worried that placing the LEGO bot in front of the Create would slow its run from the starting box, hindering it in quickly reaching the enemy slope (this would make it easier for them to put a walling robot in place to guard their slope or to snatch tribble cups that we sought). The second experiment was we placed our Create from last year (rigged with manual controls) in the opponent’s starting box and had it “race” our current robots to the objects we sought to collect. This was to determine the effectiveness of our current bots and set a control or standard for our experimentation.  </p>
<p><strong>Describe what you were hoping to evaluate with the experiment.</strong><br />
The first experiment was merely to ensure that limitations of the botball rules were met. The second experiment was to determine the effectiveness of placing the Create in front of the LEGObot and to see how much it hindered LEGObot movement. The effectiveness of the LEGObot movement is crucial to the strategy, so this was highly investigated to ensure that the minimum amount of time was taken to reach the opponent's slope.  </p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from this process?</strong><br />
We discovered two important issues: the enemy Create easily beat our Create to the center of the board (it could potentially steal tribble cups we were after and certainly Botguy, though it is not final whether Botguy is part of our strategy), and that surprisingly, our LEGO bot was not fast enough to the opponents’ target slope to block their Create.  This meant that the current method did not optimize the amount of time taken for the LEGObot to reach the opponent's slope. In the first test, we continued to refine our method until the system met requirements. Many of our earlier refinements did not fit the limitations of the box. </p>
<p><strong>How did it affect your design?</strong><br />
  The Create underwent much less refinement than the LEGO Bot due to the relative simplicity of its mechanisms. However, the detachable bulldozer has undergone series of modifications nonetheless. The first design of the LEGO robot involved an (almost) all-metal bulldozer device, the sides of which were &quot;forks&quot; that protruded from starting box entirely. These were each made from two of the long, thin, flexible, metal bars mounted above one another that extended (mounted to a metal beam) out from the &quot;front&quot; of the Create (Create drives with its bumper, the usual front, backwards because robot requires the extra room afforded by spacious area in its back) at full length (this is the Stage 1 bulldozer scoop).<br />
We decided to fold them roughly in half (they were malleable, this was easy to achieve with pliers; this is the Stage 2 bulldozer scoop). However, these half-forks were still too long for the LEGO robot to fit behind the Create if the Create was to face forward out of the starting box. But we had noted that both robots would fit if we placed the Create in the back of the starting box and placed the LEGO Bot between its arms. The second experiment prompted us to place a ramp  (incline) in the back of our starting box that would allow our LEGO bot to hop the PVC at the beginning of the match. However, this decision exacerbated the fork arm length problem. Consequently, we shifted the folded forks backwards just far enough so that the LEGO robot, the ramp, the Create, and all of its mechanisms could easily fit in the starting box, but not so far as to diminish the Create’s ability to manipulate objects present in its clutches (Stage 3).  </p>
<p><span class="style1">The Legobot, The Incline, and The Skid</span><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Briefly describe the testing procedure.</strong><br />
  After the previous testing of the Legobot’s speed, we decided to build an incline in which the Legobot is placed on, in the starting box. The Legobot was programmed to ride up the incline, cross the PVC pipe, and fall down. However, a little problem occurred. After the Legobot goes up the incline, and as it is about to fall down of the PVC pipe, the skid gets caught in the space between the PVC pipe and incline. Sometimes, however, the Legobot is successful in its journey… and other times, not so much. In order to ensure higher success rate, something had to be done.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Describe what you were hoping to evaluate with the experiment.</strong><br />
  There was on main point to the experiment. It was to see how well the Legobot is able to cross the PVC safely, successfully, and hastily. However, a problem with the skid occurred [while the Legobot attempted to the cross the PVC pipe]. We tested this over a few more times; in order to see how successfully the Legot is able to cross the PVC pipe, and how often the skid would get stuck. After myriad trails, we came to the conclusion that taking the risk wasn’t worth it. In order to fix the problem, we had to make changes to either: the ramp, the skid, the Legobot’s height, or some other sort of re-designing need to happen. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from this process?</strong><br />
  From this process, we learned that the best way to solve the problem [of the skid being stuck in the gap of the incline and the PVC pipe] is to place a slanted platform so the skid can rest on it, as the bot escalates up the ramp. We learned that the success-rate [of the Legobot successfully crossing the PVC pipe safely over via the incline] wasn’t worth taking the risk, so we built an incline. We also learned that the Create’s bulldozer may need to be shortned [length-wise] in order for the incline, the Legobot, and the Create to all fit in the starting box.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>How did it affect your design?</strong><br />
  This affected our design on the incline, because we need some type of support for the skid, to guide it safely and securely off the incline, and across the PVC pipe. Adding the incline was a crucial part on hardware. Not only did it affect the Legobot, it also affected the Create. Due to the incline being in the starting box, it takes up space. The Create’s bulldozer, in return, had to be shortened in length [so that it would fit in the starting box]. Also, adding the slanted platform to the incline was really important because that is what prevented the skid from getting stuck in between the incline and the PVC pipe. The piece added to the ramp, helped provide support and a gap-less passageway off of the PVC pipe.</p>
