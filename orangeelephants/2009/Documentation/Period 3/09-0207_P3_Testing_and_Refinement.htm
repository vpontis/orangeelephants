  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Robot Testing 
for Reliability: Create</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Repeated Test Runs</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At first, based on the size 
of the bulldozer of the Create, much of the reliability of the Creates 
path depended on the placement of the Create in the starting box at 
the beginning of the round. If placed correctly, the Create ran its 
path successfully nine out of ten times, depending on the stability 
of the placement at the initiate of the round. However, if the Create 
is not placed correctly at the commencement of the round, it only runs 
two out of ten times successfully, only succeeding by either luck or 
just slightly running into a part of the PVC as it is making its first 
turn. Now, as we have altered the bulldozer to be more portable and 
less bulky, the placement of the Create at the beginning of the round 
is much more lenient. Running a perfect ten out of ten rounds, the Create 
only has a problem every one out of one hundred tests. The main problem 
is when the base of the bulldozer runs into the connecter, knocking 
some if not all of the collected items contained inside the bulldozer 
out. In order to fix the problem, we have repeatedly re-engineered the 
base of the bulldozer to try and compensate for the connector. Another 
problem that is aroused that affects the reliability of the Create is 
the turning on the slope. Because of the added metal pieces at the bottom 
of the bulldozer which compensates for the connector, the bulldozer 
turns at an awkward angle as the Create is turning up the slope. In 
order to compensate for this problem and make our robot more reliable, 
we had to give up some speed and slow down our turns, in order to ensure 
the reliability of our bulldozer of the Create to contain its contents 
and bring them up to the slope to score maximum points. Other then these 
two main problems the only other problems inhibiting the reliability 
of the Create is the possibility of running into another moving robot 
and ending up hitting the PVC which can throw our entire path off.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Testing with Other Robots </b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In order to simulate a proper 
competition run, we used a Create that we had last year and placed it 
in key locations to imitate live double elimination-round test runs. 
Many problems occurred as our code mostly depends on our Create scoring 
and attacking the opposing team’s starting box without interruption. 
Minor bumps or brushes with another object is negligible however, full 
on collisions or anything above minor throws off our Create completely, 
rendering it useless for the rest of the round. To compensate for this, 
our objective became to just get things done quicker and more efficiently 
then the opposing team. By rushing straight out of our starting box 
and driving full speed to the top our slope, collecting whatever resources 
we can along the way, we hope to ensure at least partial scoring. This 
method proved to be very reliable as our slope is closer to our starting 
box then the opposing team’s starting box making it 100% reliable 
that our Create scores points despite any possible collisions. After 
our Create scores, neglecting any collisions with other robots, we send 
it down to the opposing team’s starting box to try and knock any points 
they could potentially have out of the box. Repeated testing proved 
very reliable especially with the added addition to our bulldozer at 
the front of the Create, ensuring 100% success of forcing any points 
the opposing team has scored in their starting box.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Testing Under Different 
Battery Levels</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After so many repeated testing’s 
to ensure the reliability of our Create, we have noticed a tread at 
the end of every couple of hours of testing. As the power drains on 
our Create, lots of things are affected: turning, nimbleness, speed, 
force, and above all, movement. With less battery level, the create 
becomes less able to accomplish tasks that we ask it to do, everything 
from turning a full 180 degrees to climbing up a slope, is hindered 
by its battery level. The major difference is the distance our create 
travels when the battery level is low. Repeated tests have shown that 
distances gets cut down by about 70% when battery is at its lowest. 
Knowing this, our programmers are contemplating a method that reads 
the battery level of the Create and adjusts the distances we have set 
to alter it accordingly. However, we cannot alter the power of how forcefully 
our Create can ram into objects and other bots, an important part in 
our strategy, thus to be able to ensure full reliability of the Creates 
performance ability, we have a second battery pack from previous years 
Create that we switch off after every hour or so of testing, keeping 
one of the two charging at all times. During the competition, we will 
have both battery packs completely charged and at least one constantly 
charging in order to ensure the efficiency of our Create</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Testing Under Different 
Lighting</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As none of our game plans or 
key strategies of the Create require a light sensor, we have only tested 
the only key part of the match that requires a light sensor: the initiation 
of the round. Using the light sensor funneled with dark tape, we have 
ensured 100% success in the ability of the sensor to read the bright 
light that will be turned on signaling the commencement of the round, 
represented by a bright flashlight, and start the Create as fast as 
possible. Without the dark tape to funnel the signal light, we have 
had problems with other sources of light being caught in the censor, 
initiating the Create unintentionally. Applying the funnel to make the 
censor only read the one source of light that matters during the competition 
has ensured the success and reliability of our light sensor.  </font> <br>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Robot Testing 
for Reliability: Legobot</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Briefly describe the tests 
that you performed.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We performed myriad of tests 
on the Legobot. Brutal and rigorous was tests were performed on the 
Legobot to assess its defense against the Create. Basically, the Create 
collided into the Legobot to test the Legobot’s blocking ability. 
These tests provided us a good indication of the strength of our Legobot.  
With the combination of pure power and a bulldozer, the Create provided 
us with a great counterpart.  The Create was also much bigger and 
should have been able to plow through the Legobot no problem.  
After the rigorous testing, we made changes that would ensure that Legobot 
used the surrounding PVC to help it stay in position.  The end 
product of this testing was a robot that would be able to block big, 
powerful robots like our Create.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another test that was performed 
for the Legobot was the testing of the efficiency of the incline. The 
test was to see how well the Legobot can get off of the incline and 
how safely it can cross over the PVC Pipe.  We had the Legobot 
go over the PVC and then we would mark the direction using electric 
tape.  These two tests were the basis for our Legobot’s testing 
for reliability.  We believe that as long as these two are constantly 
successful, we will be able to do very well at the Southern California 
Region Competition</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Describe what you were hoping 
to evaluate with the experiment.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There were two things that 
we were hoping to evaluate with the experiment. One, being how well 
the Legobot’s defensive mechanism works. This was tested with by having 
the Create smash into the Legobot at full-speed.  We hoped that 
the end result be a Legobot with full defensive capabilities, meaning 
it would not budge even as the powerful and large robots would try and 
get through.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second evaluation we were trying 
to make was the safety and efficiency of the Legobot’s ability to 
go across the PVC Pipe.  We knew that going over the PVC would 
be a danger because it meant that we could have variable directions 
when crossing over.  For this reason we needed to test and refine 
the Legobot until we had a consistent angle.  It didn’t matter 
if the Legobot ended up orthogonal to the PVC or even close to parallel 
as long as it was consistent.  We could take these changes to account 
when writing our code.  Luckily for our team, the Legobot ends 
up at the perfect angle when getting to the other side of the PVC, which 
is when it makes a 70 degree angle to with PVC.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Present the results of your 
testing.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The results of these two scenarios 
have been the basis for reconstruction on our Legobot.  We ran 
into many problems when we tested the blocking capabilities of the robot.  
We had trouble getting the Legobot to use the surrounding PVC efficiently.  
At first, the robot would just flop over and the PVC wouldn’t even 
help block against the opposing Create.  We fixed this by manipulating 
the ends of the arms so they would catch and hook under the PVC.  
After making this change, we noticed that the force of the Create was 
still large enough to flip the Legobot on its side.  We fixed this 
by adding Lego wheels to the end of the arms which were mounted so they 
would be placed higher on the slope.  This allowed the Legobot 
to not topple over because of the wheels.  We also rammed the Legobot 
from different angles.  This showed us that the Legobot was strong 
when hit straight on but not from the side.  We decided that our 
left and right blocking wasn’t sufficient either so we added bars 
to the ends of the arms to counteract a force another robot moving it 
left and right.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our first tests showed that 
our Legobot was very inconsistent when driving off the incline.  
It would end up at different angles after getting to the other side 
or the PVC.  The angles ranged 90 degrees apart, which posed a 
problem for reliability.  To solve this problem, we added a drawbridge 
to one side or the incline.  This allowed us to counter balance 
the side without the servos mounted.  After making these changes, 
we tested the Legobot again.  The reason for the Legobot to be 
unbalanced was because of the servos.  Our results showed that 
the Legobot faced the same general direction 95% of the time with it 
facing further right the other 5%.  Also when it shifted to the 
right, it only did so by 10 degrees which can be compensated by changes 
in code.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>What changes did you make 
to your design as a result of this testing?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After ramming the Legobot, 
we found multiple things wrong with it.  One problem was that it 
didn’t use the PVC sufficiently.  To solve this problem, we adjusted 
the arms so that they would be able to hook under the PVC.  Another 
problem was that the Legobot was easy to flip over.  We fixed this 
by adding wheels to the ends or the arms that counter acted the force 
that causes it to flip over.  The last thing that we noticed from 
our testing was that the robot was easy to move left and right.  
We added bars to the ends of the arms to stop it from shifting left 
and right.  The end result was a Legobot that would be able to 
blocking virtually any robot trying to go score points in their own 
slope and peak.  We hope that this robot holds up and doesn’t 
allow any robots to get through and score points for the other team.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Due to the lopsidedness of 
the Legobot something needed to be changed regarding the Legobot or 
the incline. We figured that changing the incline would be the best 
and most reasonable decision. Since we couldn’t do much about servos 
and the Legobot was pretty much set. So, we ended up modifying the incline 
to having a “draw-down”-like bridge. This helped the Legobot balance 
out, and it is also a great mechanism to guide the Legobot across the 
PVC Pipe. Also we added 3 IR-sensors to the Legobot in order for the 
Legobot to be able to detect the black line and follow it. This is to 
be able to detect where the black tape is so that the Legobot can go 
to it, set itself, and drop down its arms.</font></p>
